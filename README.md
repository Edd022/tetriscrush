This is a project that combines two games: Tetris and Candy Crush.  
You have Tetris pieces with different colors, organized into blocks. Here are the effects:  

- **3 colors:** Blocks of that color are removed.  
- **4 colors:** Removing blocks of that color also deletes an entire row or column.  
- **5 colors:** Removes all blocks of that color from the board.  
- **6 colors:** Clears the entire board.  

Enjoy!
